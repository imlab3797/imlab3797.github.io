***           Erase From...           ***

* You should name this file as "msRyu" for Myeongseok Ryu and "nMonzen" for Niklas Monzen.
* When you finalize the post, move this file to "_members" folder.
* Save picture you use in "static/img/members/original_pics" folder.
* You can use alternative image for the profile picture.
  - For example, when you position your mouse on the profile picture, it will show the alternative image.

* Highly recommended to use the same name as the file name for picture,
  so that you can easily find the picture later.
  - For alternative image, use the same name as the file name, but add "-alt" at the end.
* After you save the original image, you can resize it using "crop.py" script.
  - For example, if you save the original image as "msRyu.jpg", use "$ python crop.py".
  - This will create "msRyu.jpg" in the "static/img/members" folder.

* You can refer to previous projects for the format in "_members" folder.
