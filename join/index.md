## Join Us
We are actively seeking highly motivated students and researchers who are eager to contribute to our mission.
Below are the preferred qualifications and application procedures for each position.


### Graduate Programs (M.S. / Ph.D.)

We warmly welcome students with a strong background in computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or related fields. Prior research experience in deep learning, image/video analysis, or data-centric AI is highly encouraged but not mandatory.

Students with strong mathematical foundations, programming skills (Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow), and problem-solving abilities will be well-prepared to conduct impactful research in our group and grow as independent researchers.

Our research focuses on:

- Connect Vision (Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Learning, Large Vision Models)
- Population Vision (Crowd Analysis, Large-Scale Visual Understanding, Data-Centric AI)
