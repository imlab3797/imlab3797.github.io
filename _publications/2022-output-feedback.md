abstract: "
This paper devises an output-feedback multi-loop positioning technique adopting the speed observer and multi-motor synchronizer, targeting the dual (master and slave) motor elevator system applications, providing the three contributions. First, the order-reduction observer continuously extracts the speed information from the motor position measurement, independent of the system model information. Second, the order-reduction stabilizer accomplishes the speed synchronization tasks for both the master and slave motors. Third, the resultant feedback system guarantees to exponentially recover the desired first-order transfer function from the reference to the actual motor position despite the model-plant mismatches. The prototype elevator system adopting the dual motor experimentally validates the practical advantages of the proposed technique.
