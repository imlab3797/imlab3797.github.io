abstract: "
This study presents a novel speed-tracking controller by considering not only model-plant mismatches but also load variations. The proposed solution has a simple conventional proportional–integral (PI) controller structure, including a specially structured feedback gain with respect to active damping and cut-off frequency, invoking an order reduction to 1 despite inclusion of the additional integral action. A prototype 400 W brushless DC motor dynamo system was constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution compared with the conventional PI controller equipped with a well-tuned feedback gain.
