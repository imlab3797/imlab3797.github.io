abstract: >
  The increasing demand for automation has driven significant research in CCTV surveillance systems. These systems collect large volumes of data from multiple sources, often containing redundant and irrelevant information. Effective data collection and prioritization are therefore essential for efficient surveillance. Additionally, secure data dissemination is crucial to ensure the authenticity and integrity of information for accurate decision-making. This paper provides an overview of multimedia data security techniques, including image hashing, image encryption, image steganography, and watermarking, for secure data transmission in CCTV systems. Furthermore, it discusses the integration of multiple security techniques in a sequential manner to develop a more robust and secure data dissemination framework for surveillance applications.
